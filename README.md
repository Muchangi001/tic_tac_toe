# OVERVIEW
Just made the opponent more challenging by using **mini-max** algorithm.

# HOW TO PLAY
The source files are already compiled **(linux users only)**.   
To play the game run the *"tic_tac_toe" executable in the bin folder.  
Run **"./tictactoe"** inside the bin folder.  
Windows and Mac users would have to compile the source files themselves.  

# COMPILATION USING G++ COMPILER
Run **"g++ -o bin/tictactoe src/*.cpp"** inside the project folder.
